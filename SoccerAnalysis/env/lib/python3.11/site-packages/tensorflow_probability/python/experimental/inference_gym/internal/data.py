  The dataset is split into train and test portions by randomly partitioning the
  student-question-response triplets. This has two consequences. First, the

  is a possibility of some students or questions not being present in both sets.

  `*_question_ids[i]` correctly; `*_correct[i] == 0` means they didn't.
